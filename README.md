# Spotify_clone_project

I developed a responsive Spotify Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to play music, offering a clean and intuitive interface similar to Spotify. Additionally, I incorporated extra functionality beyond the original Spotify website to enhance user experience.

Key features include:

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless usability across devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
Music Playback: Users can play/pause songs, navigate tracks, and adjust the volume.
Custom Features: Added unique functionalities that are not present in Spotifyâ€™s original interface, showcasing creativity and problem-solving skills.
Dynamic Elements: Used JavaScript to handle interactivity, such as song controls, animations, and playlist management.

This project highlights my front-end development skills and ability to deliver user-centric web applications with enhanced features.
